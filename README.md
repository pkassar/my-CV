#### My story so far

After graduating from the university of Edinburgh I decided to follow my passion and work in the music industry. By helping out at small london based electronic music label I learned about different aspects of creating and releasing music. I later interned at a Management Agency that deals with top40 artists to discover licensing and artist touring logistics.

After taking some time to think about the next steps I realised I was looking for a more challenging roles that involved technical abilities and growth prospect.

I discovered and started loving coding. I embarked on the journey that is Makers Academy: a 12-week intense course to give you the tools to learn code.

I am now looking for my first job as a developer where can grow whilst still exploring my love and understanding of music
