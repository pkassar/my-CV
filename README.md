## A little bit of story

After graduating from the university of Edinburgh I decided to follow my passion and work in the music industry. By helping out at small london based electronic music label I learned about different aspects of creating and releasing music. I later interned at a Management Agency that deals with top40 artists to discover licensing and artist touring logistics.

After taking some time to think about the next steps I realised I was looking for a more challenging roles that involved technical abilities and growth prospect.

I discovered and started loving coding. I embarked on the journey that is Makers Academy: a 12-week intense course to give you the tools to learn code.

I am now looking for my first job as a developer where can grow my skills whilst exploring my love for music.

## Other skills

**Problem solver**
Having studied mathematics on one hand and having learnt to code on the other I found that problem-solving is a constant struggle between obsession and lucidity. During my education I have managed to tackle complex problems thanks to patience and careful planning of a solution which I hope to bring to new challenges in the workplace.

**New technologies/ languages**
Through my bachelor and lately the coding course I undertook, I have had to pick up entirely new concepts and new logical frameworks in short time to be able advance in my learning and build functional web apps.

**Versatility**
Key strengths I look to bring to companies include a diverse, international, academic and social background. I have lived in Lebanon France and the UK in various cities and am now able to adapt to new environments.
