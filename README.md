One Year experience creating projects in Javascript and Ruby.
Mathematics graduate with two years working in the music industry.



## A little bit of story

 After graduating from the university of Edinburgh I decided to follow my passion and start my career in the the music industry. I started working at a small london based electronic music label where I learned about different aspects of creating and releasing music. I later interned at an Artist Management Agency to learn more about the industry and help artists develop their careers.
My daily challenges involved working in teams to help musicians and artists accomplish what they aspired to in their career in a high pressure environment. At the end of my experiences I realised I was looking for a more challenging role that involved the technical abilities I had summoned during my degree in Mathematics and needed an industry with a different growth prospect. 

I discovered and started loving coding. I embarked on the journey that is [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/): a 12 week intense course that gave me the tools to learn code. I have learnt various programming languages: Javascript, Ruby. As well as good code practice: TDD, OOP. I later attended codesmith a software engineering residency working on full-stack javascript open source projects.

## Other skills

**Problem solver**

Having studied mathematics on one hand and having learnt to code on the other I found that problem-solving is a constant struggle between obsession and lucidity. During my education I have managed to tackle complex problems thanks to patience and careful planning of a solution which I hope to bring to new challenges in the workplace.

**New concepts and languages**

Through my bachelor and lately the coding course I undertook, I have had to pick up entirely new multilayered concepts and new frameworks. Both courses have enabled me to integrate material in short time to be able advance in my learning and build on my knowledge. Recently part of a team that developed a docker compose app.

**Versatility and interpersonal skills**

Key strengths I look to bring to companies include a diverse, international, academic and social background. I have lived in Lebanon France and the UK in various cities and am now able to adapt to new environments. In my last project I was able to mediate a conflict between two equally strong team members that were quite incompatible in their character traits in order to move forward in our tasks.
